Nice chill music.
Barricades looked very spacey, so it fit with the genre.
The auditory illusion is nice.
I did not find any glitches, although clipping looks funny. The clipping seems like it helps the overall gameplay. I imagine it would be a lot harder if the clipping wasn't as it is now.
The instructions are short, blunt, and simple. However, it could use a nice graphic for the background.
Mispelled escape on the main title screen.
The credits are epic.
It has good acceleration and starting speed.
The spaceship looks cool.
The flappy spaceship is cool, but had to be pointed out to me.

Glitches:
	When at the extreme edge, no clipping occurs for any of the floors.

To play the game use the items on the right side of the screen. 
Click a spot on the grid, to the left, to place an item from the top of the stack.
Place three items that look the same next to each other to combine them into a better item.
Lightning bolts are powerups that allow you to click an item on the grid and delete it, 
just incase you make a bad move. The goal of the game is to reach the population at the top 
right side of the screen before the number of turns left hits zero.
